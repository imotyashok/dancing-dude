# Dancing Dude 
## Project Info
This was a final project for a course I took during the fall of 2018. It is a simple, short 3D animation of a little stick figure dancing. It was created using the online GlowScript IDE and was written in python 2.7 using the VPython library (which unfortunately makes the program a little outdated). 

To view the animation, you can follow this link: https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/Iryna/folder/MyPrograms/program/finalprojectwithfunctions

## Possible Improvements 
This was written a long time ago when I was very new to object oriented programming (and programming in general) using an older version of VPython and python. I am still proud of this project since it took countless hours to make and I like the resulting animation, but looking back on it now, there are a number of ways in which it could be improved. 
#### Code length
The first thing you may notice right away is that the code for this is long. Very long. There are around 650 lines of code for a 10-15 second animation. A large number of lines of code isn't necessarily bad, but in my case, a lot of the code seems very repetitive. I could simplify the code a lot more if I used better defined functions. 
#### Main function
This isn't an absolute necessity, but if I were to rewrite this program, I would include a main function for clarity and organization purposes.
#### Classes
The program does not include any classes, but it would make sense to make a StickPerson class where I would initialize each component of the stick person (arms, head, torso, legs) to make the program more object oriented and organized rather than just making separate functions for the arms, head, torso, and legs.
